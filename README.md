#### A simple self-hosted personal file hosting and sharing platform.

---

## Build and Install
Firstly, ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), and preferably [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), installed. ([Don't have Git?](#dont-have-git))

Clone and enter the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ThatOtherAndrew/FileForest.git
cd FileForest
```
Use Docker Compose to build and run the project:
```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```
And that's it! ✨

### Don't have Git?
Instead of running `git clone`, click on the green `Code ▼` button at the top of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/ThatOtherAndrew/FileForest), and select `Download ZIP`. Extract the ZIP file to your preferred location, and run the `cd` command with the appropriate file path. Then, proceed with Docker Compose as above.
